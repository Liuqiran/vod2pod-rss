# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Fix for small bugs or typos can be opened out of the blue as long as they don't alter the flow of the program too much.

When adding a feature try to also add some test if possible.

## Pull Request Process

All pull request should point to the main branch and should pass all tests (`make test`)

## How does it work?

vod2pod-rss under the hood is a service that takes an hosted RSS feed (public feed or generated by a service reggistered in it's docker-compose.yml)
and adapts it by rewriting every media url to point to the trancode endpoint of vod2pod-rss webserver, you can actually give it any
RSS podcast feed and if ffmpeg can transcode the contained media URLS then it will work (you would need to add the domain to the whitelist, check the README for more info). 

If that is not enough and you want to add a new media provider that need some API calls to work just check the provider folder
and implement the MediaProvider trait (more info are in the module), then feel free to open a PR.

also check the [podtube](https://github.com/amckee/PodTube) repo if the provider you need is already offered by it, if it does you just need to
write the provider to point to the right podtube feed urls

## Initial setup

### github spaces development setup

[pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)

At the time of this guide, the free tier offers 60 hours of free usage on a standard 2 core machine

launch a new codepace here

wait for the post script to end and your good to go (be sure to close and reopen the terminal or most commands will fail)

you will still need to add your apikeys to the .dev.env file and run `make start-deps` to have all features enabled

### local development setup

#### Requirements

you need to meake sure those commands are installed on your machine

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
- redis-cli (`sudo apt install redis`)
- ffmpeg (`sudo apt install ffmpeg`)
- yt-dlp (`sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 install yt-dlp`)
- cargo ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Editor setup for rust development, for [VScode here is a guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)

you can install the deps automatically on fedora and ubuntu with

`make install-fedora-deps`

or

`make install-ubuntu-deps`

**You will need to install Docker separately**

## General development commands

### set enviroment variables

after launching the deps install script edit the `.env` file that was generated in the root folder with your api keys if needed (be sure to not commit your secrets accidentally)

### launch required services (!!!REQUIRED!!!)

run `make start-deps`

you need to run at least once at the start of your development session (in codespaces this is done automatically)

### launch tests

run `make test`

### launch the server

run `make run`

### automatically run the project when making changes

run `make hot-reload`

### build the container image locally

run `make image`
