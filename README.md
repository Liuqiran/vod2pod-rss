# VoDToPodcastRSS

take any atom or rss feed and transcode it to a podcast rss where possible, works with youtube atom channel feed and with twitch by combinign my other project TwitchToPodcastRSS

this project works, some code cleaning is needed before I move to write the documentation and share a prebuild docker image, in the meanwhile if you know how to use docker-compose you whould be able to build it and play around with it

example usage:

give the link to a podcast player and enjoy
